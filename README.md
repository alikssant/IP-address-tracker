This is a solution to the [IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0).

## Overview

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- useEffect – React hook used for side effects such as API requests
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Geo.IPify API](https://geo.ipify.org/docs) - Used to fetch geolocation data based on IP
- [OpenStreetMap Tiles](https://www.openstreetmap.org/help) - Used for map

### What I learned

- Integrating OpenStreetMap for mapping functionality: I explored how OpenStreetMap can be used to embed and reference maps without relying on commercial APIs. This introduced me to working with open geographic data and customizing map views via URL parameters.
- Improved my debugging and problem-solving skills: Throughout the project, I encountered several unexpected behaviors. Using browser DevTools and community resources like Stack Overflow helped me trace bugs and understand JavaScript behavior more deeply.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me understand JavaScript methods and browser behavior. I really liked how comprehensive the explanations were and will use it going forward.
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) - This is an amazing article series which helped me finally understand concepts like closures, event loops, and DOM events. I’d recommend it to anyone still learning JavaScript.
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/help) - This helped me integrate open-source map data into my project. I really liked how customizable and lightweight it was compared to commercial mapping APIs.
